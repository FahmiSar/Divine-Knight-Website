            The Vermillion Knight also known as a Crimson Demon with a thousand weapons. Found in the 
            depths of the Imperial Capital where it was sealed until Duke Cayenne took the young Prince Cedric and forced
            him to resonate with the Divine Knight. Duke Cayenne had plans of using the Vermillion Knight's power
            in order to win the power feud during the Civil War. Unfortunately for him Crow and Rean took down the berserk 
            Vermillion Knight using the powers of their Divine Knights thus freeing Cedric from the Duke's evil hands. However
            the Vermillion Knight was cursed long ago causing the now pilot of the Knight, Cedric, to bear the malice from the Knight
            causing his personality to change drastically. This led Chancellor Giliath Osborne to seek out the Prince for his group known
            as the Ironbloods.
