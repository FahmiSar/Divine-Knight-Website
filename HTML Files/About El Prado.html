            El Prado, The Auric Knight, is known as the strongest among the other divine knights alongside the Argent
            Knight. Both the Auric and Argent both have fought the most battles than the other knights. It has the ability to generate
            a powerful force field that can block attacks with minimal effort. It also is able to clock itself allowing for more stealthy 
            actions, as that was his primary way of taking down the Argent knight; by appearing behind it for a sneak attack.
            
            During the Great Twilight, Rufus Albarea seized control of the swamps on the outskirts of Crossbell as it possessed the proper
            conditions to summon El Prado.
