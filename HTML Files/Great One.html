           A being that should not exist, the eighth Divine Knight. The Great One, the completed version of the fusion of all seven 
           Divine Knights. The only reason it came to be is because of hypothetical future Elysium
           had created where in, Rean and Valimar fuse with Ishmelga and get corrupted by it's malice.
           It's awakener is an Alternative version of Rean who did not seek the Holy Beast of Earth's power and
           became one with Ishmelga.
