            The Ebon Knight, the true antagonist of the Trails of Cold Steel games and orchestrator
            of every disaster that befell the Erebonian Empire. Ishmelga had sought to create a great disaster
            in the form of the Great Twilight in order to resurrect the Great One, a being that had been split into the
            seven Divine Knights. Ishemlga's current awakener is Giliath Osborne, biological father of Rean Schwarzer.
            On April 22, S.1192, a group of pro-war mercenaries murdered Osborne's wife and mortally wounded Osborne's son along with
            setting their house ablaze. Osborne, who wasn't home at the time due to his job in the military, rushed home to find his wife and child at death's door.
            His wife's dying wish was to ensure that Rean survived, to which Osborne had cried out pleaing anything and anyone to save his son. To which Ishmelga revealed
            itself and made a deal with Osborne in exchange to save his son. This deal would cause Osborne to become the awakener of the Ebon Knight
            and lead him to be used by Ishmelga and his goal for a world war.

            During the final rivalry, Valimar won against Ishmelga causing him to fuse with Rean and Valimar. Together they vanquished
            Ishmelga with the help of the Holy Beast of Earth's power
