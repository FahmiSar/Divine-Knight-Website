            The Palatinate Knight. Described to be one of the weakest of the seven knights alongside Valimar and Ordine.
            His previous awakener was an unnamed mercenary hired by the Sixth Prince, his current awakener is Rutger Claussell
            who is also a mercenary. Rutger had died in a battle against Baldur Orlando, this battle was set up by Black Alberich
            who wanted to revive one of them to be the awakener of Zector. This led to Zector being revived causing Rutger to be an Immortal.
            During Trails Of Cold Steel IV, Rutger had fought Rean and Valimar in a Spirt Shrine where Rutger lost and got absorbed into Valimar.
